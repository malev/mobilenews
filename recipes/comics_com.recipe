He left his job as Art Director to establish his own service as a graphic designer working for syndication, advertising agencies and various design studios in Manhattan. Mora's proximity to syndicated features while working as an art director led to his own interest in creating a feature. He wrote \"Alexander Gate,\" a continuity strip illustrated by Frank Bolle; \"Dear Debbie,\" a lovelorn column; and, ultimately, Graffiti. The chance to use his design and lettering skills along with the opportunity to write seemed a perfect fit, and he has been producing the feature since 1969."

Russ Wallace was born into a family of lobstermen in a small Iowa fishing village. Russ was never satisfied with the fishing life. Instead, his idols were the great MAD Magazine artists Mort Drucker and Jack Davis, as well as a host of editorial cartoonists. He painstakingly studied their work while trying to develop a style of his own. Wallace studied at Marshall University and the University of Virginia, eventually emerging with a medical degree.  He practiced neurosurgery until he came to his senses and realized that medicine would always involve getting up really early and having to talk to people. With this epiphany he proceeded to illustrate a book written by his father, who then encouraged him to try his hand at editorial cartooning. He became the editorial cartoonist for the Charleston Gazette and was the runner-up to the prestigious Scripps-Howard National Press Award in his first year of cartooning.  From this Natural Selection was born. Russ Wallace resides in the Southeast. He has been joined for the last 15 years by a female human who \"appears to be in charge.\" Later, two smaller humans and a dog showed up. They frequently ask to be driven places and eat a lot."

A wide-eyed innocent who marvels at the world and asks endless questions, Duncan is loved by everyone - even the cat.  Chris Browne, an accomplished comic artist who grew up in Wilton, Connecticut.

Raising Duncan is inspired by Browne's love for his wife, Carroll, and for their 11 year-old Scottish Terrier, MacDuff. \"There has been a trend in the comics lately towards cynicism,\" says Browne. \"Raising Duncan runs like the wind in the other direction.

For Carl Moore, a self-described \"fallen liberal,\" his journey to becoming a cartoonist has taken a few strange turns. The cartoonist was once a radical socialist majoring in English literature at the University of California at Berkeley in the early '60s. After watching some fellow socialists throw bricks at police during a 1968 demonstration, however, Moore began to rethink his political leanings. Once he received his degree from design school in 1989, Moore became a freelance editorial cartoonist, publishing his work in newspapers such as the Long Beach Press-Telegram and the San Diego Union-Tribune. He also began drawing cartoons that appeared regularly in the National Review. "

The Humble Stumble was born in late 2000 when Roy Schneider suddenly found himself in the unfamiliar and scary position of being fully responsible for the upbringing of his then-9-year-old daughter. Schneider originally created the comic as therapy, as the sometimes overwhelming new challenges of being both Mom and Dad often left Roy with no choice but to laugh at himself while attempting unfamiliar domestic tasks (for example, \"stumbling\" back and forth through the grocery store for an hour and a half to find six items).  Roy Schneider has been a professional cartoonist since 1992. His work has been published in magazines, greeting cards, card games and other media, but his goal from the start has been to have a syndicated daily comic strip; probably the result of learning to read from stacks of Peanuts and Dennis the Menace paperbacks as a very young child. In addition to Charles Schulz and Hank Ketcham, his earliest influences include MAD magazine's Sergio Aragones and Don Martin, classic animation from Warner Brothers and MGM (director Tex Avery, in particular), later studying the work of such underground artists as Gilbert Shelton and Robert Crumb, and becoming an avid Monty Python fan. He was eventually lured back to the newspaper comics pages when Bill Watterson's \"Calvin and Hobbes\" caught his attention quite profoundly in the late 1980s. In addition to cartooning, Roy is a professional musician and enjoys music festivals, camping, cooking, travel and getting horrendously dirty and sweaty out in the yard.

The Wizard of Id has been enchanting audiences since 1964, but the real wizards behind this comic classic were artist Brant Parker and writer Johnny Hart. The pair began paving the path to the Kingdom of Id in 1950, when Parker, a staff artist for the Binghamton Press in upstate New York, was asked to judge a high school art contest. Among the entrants was teenager Johnny Hart, whose work so impressed Parker that he arranged a meeting. Parker and Hart discovered a mutual interest in cartooning, hired an agent and began submitting work to such magazines as the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Good Housekeeping. By the end of the decade, Parker was working as an art director at IBM and Hart had created the comic strip B.C., a prehistoric parody of modern man's foibles.  In 1964, Hart brought that comic concept even further up to date -- from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages, to be exact -- added a castle of characters and took the premise of The Wizard of Id to Parker. More than a quarter of a century later, Brant Parker passed the torch to his son, Jeff, in 1997.  The kingdom they conjured up thrives as well. The Wizard of Id is syndicated to more than 1,000 newspapers worldwide, has generated more than a score of trade paperbacks and consistently earns top rankings in readership polls.

After graduating from high school in Madison, Wis., Stantis and his family returned to Southern California, and Scott enrolled at Los Angeles Community College and California State University, Long Beach. Shortly after being kicked out of the latter, he landed the job of editorial cartoonist for the Orange County Register. Thus began his career in earnest. Next he was hired by The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tenn. Additional editorial cartoon jobs followed, first at The Arizona Republic and now at the Chicago Tribune. He lives in Hoover, Ala., with a mortgage, car payments, his wife Janien (since 1981) and two sons. He also has a box turtle and a dog named Dogzilla. When Scott isn't creating editorial cartoons, he works on a comic strip, 'The Buckets,' and other animation projects. He also writes screenplays, reads, collects political memorabilia, plays with his kids, walks the dog and ignores his yard."

After acquiring a BA in English from a western university of middling academic reputation, Wilkinson was unprepared for real work ... so she became a reporter, stringing for the West Chester (PA) Daily Local News. She also worked for the Quakers, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and with a housing project in Cyprus, a job that ended with a bang when a coup d'etat was followed by a military invasion from Turkey. Back in the newsroom, Wilkinson began drawing the people she was supposed to be reporting on. She realized cartooning combined her interests in art and politics without taxing her interest in spelling. After a year of remedial art school, including a stint at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, she began freelancing at several Philadelphia and New York publications, finally landing a full-time job at the San Jose Mercury News in 1982. After 3 1\/2 years on a steep learning curve, Wilkinson repaid her long-suffering Mercury News editor by taking a job at the Philadelphia Daily News. In addition to her five cartoons a week for the Daily News, Wilkinson has drawn mulch-based cartoons for Organic Gardening magazine, mortarboard-based cartoons for the Institute for Research on Higher Education and water-based cartoons for the University Barge Club newsletter. \"How to Grow the $735 Tomato\" is the title of her 1999 gardening calendar. Her awards include the 1992 Pulitzer Prize, the 1991 Berryman Award and 1997 Overseas Press Club Award. Her most cherished honor was being named \"the Pennsylvania state vegetable substitute\" by the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1989.bb"
